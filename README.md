# cv_tex_src

# source code of my curriculum vitae in french and english versions made with latex

The [moderncv](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) package is also needed to compiling this file .

> moderncv provides facilities for typesetting modern curriculums vitae, both in a classic and in a casual style.

There are 2 ways to use the moderncv package :

1. **The clean way :** can downloading the texlive-latex-extra package (with your package manager) which contains moderncv .
2. **The dirty way :**  you can also directly downloading  moderncv , unziping it , and putting all the *.sty* files in the same folder as your *.tex* file .
